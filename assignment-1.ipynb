    "#1. Simple and Readable Syntax\n",
    "# - Simplified code, it is great for new programmers\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. High-Level Language\n",
    "# - Omits computationally intensive details and directs the audienceâ€™s attention to the solved problem\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. Interpreted Language\n",
    "# - Runs the code line by line which helps in debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. Dynamically Typed\n",
    "# - No declaration required for variables due to which there is no need for type declaration also as the type is determined at runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. Extensive Standard Library\n",
    "# - Somewhat a rich library with many modules for different operations thus eliminating the need to program them from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "#6. Cross-Platform Compatibility\n",
    "# - It is compatible with file systems of different operating systems without the need for a new code rewrite\n",
    "\n",
    "#7. Large Community and Support\n",
    "# - This includes goals of having many resources available, and documented and well supported by the community\n",
    "\n",
    "#8. Integration Capabilities\n",
    "# - The completion of integration is relatively easy with other languages and technologies\n",
