    "3.Interpreted Language\n",
    "- Runs the code line by line which help in debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Dynamically Type\n",
    "- No declaration required for variable due to which there is no need of type declaration also as type is determined at runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Extensive Standard Library\n",
    "- Somewhat a rich library with many modules fore different operations thus eliminating the need to program them from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Cross-Platform Compatibility\n",
    "- It is compatible with file systems of different operating systems without the need for a new code rewrite\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Large Community and Support\n",
    "- This includes goals of having many resources available, and documented and well supported by the community\n",
